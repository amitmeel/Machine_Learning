1. What is the difference between fit and fit_transform method of scikit learn
Ans : To center the data (make it have zero mean and unit standard error), you 
      subtract the mean and then divide the result by the standard deviation.
 	 
		x′=(x−μ)/σ

      You do that on the training set of data. But then you have to apply the same
      transformation to your testing set (e.g. in cross-validation), or to newly
      obtained examples before forecast. But you have to use the same two parameters
      μ and σ (values) that you used for centering the training set.
      Hence, every sklearn's transform's fit() just calculates the parameters  
     (e.g. μ and σ in case of StandardScaler) and saves them as an internal objects state. 
     Afterwards, you can call its transform() method to apply the transformation to a particular set of examples.
     fit_transform() joins these two steps and is used for the initial fitting of parameters on the training set x,
     but it also returns a transformed x′. Internally, it just calls first fit() and then transform() on the same data.
